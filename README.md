## Inspiration üßë‚Äçüé®
Teachers are always making learning easier for students so that they can excel, but sometimes it becomes tough while explaining a code, where the problem can have multiple code solutions from brute force to optimal trade offs, and also difficult for students to ask doubts on a particular line of code to why a particular line is written, A platform where the coding and interaction can be made easier and fun is much needed.

## What it does ‚õ≥
Code-Meet is a website solely designed for Teachers and Students, to make learning fun and easy.

* The editing code feature can be handled both by Teacher and students so that student can also give the input and can make the code optimal.
* Ask a doubt section would let teacher know on which line the student has a doubt.

* We have designed our code collab page in such a way that its convinient for teachers as well as students to learn and ask their doubts.

* Students just need to enter the Code Room Unique Id Shared by their Teachers and can get in and learn without any hindrance.

## How we built it üöß

- We used ReactJS for the website.
- We used Firebase Cloud Messaging(FCM) for the push notification. When someone visits our website, we ask them to allow the notification which gives us the token of there browser which helps FCM server to send the notification to the browser. We first register service-worker in the user's browser so that it can listen to the notification and trigger push notification in the user's browser. 
- We used Figma to make the designs for the website.
- We used GitHub-Pages for the deployement.

## Challenges we ran into ü©π
We had a problem hosting the project on GitHub pages and adding configuration to register the service worker to the user's browser, It was built using react+firebase and that made it somewhat tricky to host it on pages. However, we fixed all the issues and hosted them on GitHub.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ
We are elated to use Github for hosting it. We have used the feature of Github available.
We have a team of  **50%  first-time hackers** and each of them tried their best to contribute we are proud that we completed every aspect as we thought of for the project.

## What we learned üïØÔ∏è
We learned to team management, and each and everyone was assigned a task that they completed amazingly,  and the experience from the ideation, prototyping and presentation made us learn very new things. Apart from that, we learned the push notifications concept, reactjs, and a lot more.

## What's next for Code-Meet üßë‚Äçüíª
* Adding Test Cases features with quick compilation so that a Teacher can add test cases and can better judge student's code.
* TImer with different themes of editors, making coding fun for everyone.
